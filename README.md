# Smart Agriculture Monitoring and Irrigation System

This Project is a part of my Bachelors degree.

Internet of Everything has brought revolution to each field of common manâ€™s life. The 
development of Intelligent Smart Agriculture IoT based devices is day by day turning the face of 
agriculture production by not only enhancing it but also making it cost-effective and reducing 
wastage. The aim / objective of this report is to propose IoT based Smart Agriculture System 
assisting farmers in getting Live Data (Temperature, Soil Moisture) for efficient environment 
monitoring which will enable them to increase their overall yield and quality of products. The IoT 
based Smart Farming System being proposed via this report is integrated with NodeMCU 
Technology along with different Sensors producing live data feed that can be obtained online. The 
product being proposed is tested on a small-scale setup
